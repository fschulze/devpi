Remove/Deprecate "master" related terminology in favor of "primary".
Usage related changes are the switch to ``--primary-url`` instead of ``--master-url`` and ``--role=primary`` instead of ``--role=master``.
Using the old terms will now output warnings.
The ``+status`` API has additional fields and the ``role`` field content will change with 7.0.0.
